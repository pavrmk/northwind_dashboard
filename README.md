# Northwind dashboard
Boot camp project: Building a dashboard summarizing the Northwind Database. It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. 

The data was forked from https://github.com/pawlodkowski/northwind_data_clean/tree/master/data.
